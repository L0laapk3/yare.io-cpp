# yare.io c++ example bot

### Install

1. Clone this repo **using `--recursive`**.
1. Get wasi cpp sdk **14.0** from https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-sdk/releases, and extract it to a folder named `wasi-sdk`. (Later versions can be experimented with, I just couldn't be bothered to figure out what was wrong)
1. (optional but recommended) Install the userscript from https://github.com/L0laapk3/yare.io-wasm to use autodeploy.

### Usage

1. Run `build.bat`.
